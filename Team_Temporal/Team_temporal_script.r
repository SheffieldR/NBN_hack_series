# Now we need to work out what year we want to use to 
# split our data into two halves
# this could be a year of biological significance, eg
# when polution got below a certain level or local protected
# areas were created. Here I just eyeball the data so roughly 
# half is before and half after the split year

# Create a vector of all the years (i use startDate just for convienience)
years <- as.numeric(format(telferData_sub$startDate, "%Y"))

# Plot this
hist(years)

# Here is the help for the function we want to use
?telfer

# we need to create a time period column
?date2timeperiod

# There are some NAs in the data we need to remove
telferData_sub <- na.omit(telferData_sub)

# Use different years when we have all the data
TP <- date2timeperiod(Date = telferData_sub[,1:2],

# Make sure these numbers are sort of balanced
table(TP)

# and now we are good to go with the analysis
telfer_results <- telfer(taxa = telferData_sub$name,
                         site = telferData_sub$oneK,
                         time_period = TP)

# this function automatically removes duplicates
# ie 2 records of the same species in the same square in teh same time period
# It is worth having a look at the paper referenced in the function to 
# see how the method works:
# Telfer, M.G., Preston, C.D., & Rothery, P. (2002) A general method for
# measuring relative change in range size from biological atlas data.
# Biological Conservation, 107, 99-109

# Lets have a look in decending order
sorted_results <- telfer_results[order(telfer_results$Telfer_1_2, decreasing = TRUE), ]
sorted_results

# Let's save this as a csv
write.csv(sorted_results, file = 'Team_Temporal/Telfer_results.csv')

# we need to read the paper and work out what these values mean
# is -1 a big decline or a small decline?
# also some of the results look a little fishy, worth digging a bit

#### IMPORTANT ####
# When we come to presenting to the results we need to acknowledge all of the
# organisations that have contributed data. To do this look at the csv output
# from the script that gets data shef_providers.csv. Note there might be duplicates
# here as providers will be written once per hectad. read in and then use unique() 
# on the dataframe to get rif of the duplicates

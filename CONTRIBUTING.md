# CONTRIBUTING

### Welcome to the Sheffield R User Group **National Biodiversity Hack series**

The hack has many objectives including promoting the use of [**NBN Gateway open data**](https://data.nbn.org.uk/), helping our local [**Sheffield & Rotherham Wildlife Trust**](http://www.wildsheffield.com/), developing and our **`R`** skills and learning to collaborate more effectively.
In that spirit we would like to explore the power of opening workflows up and **demonstrate the potential of open science practices**. So we invite anyone with an interest in the hack to get involved by **participating remotely**, **advise on particular projects** or even **just stop by and say hello!**

We've set up a hackpad:[bit.ly/Sheffield_R_NBN_hackpad](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ctbFk6Y5Dt_YMxSEoWz0bsoIHgmCN8jUsUs3TU2qKI/edit) that is open for anyone to contribute to. This github repo is obviously free for anyone to fork and work on.
We will also be broadcasting the sessions through google hangouts.

So keep an eye on the [**hackpad**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ctbFk6Y5Dt_YMxSEoWz0bsoIHgmCN8jUsUs3TU2qKI/edit) where details of all the projects and **links to the google hangouts** will appear

Hope to hear from as many of you as possible!

# Getting Started:

**Don't forget to make a fork of this project on GitHub first!**

Clone the project using RStudio and run the `setup.R` file. This will save your NBN credentials in the `NBN_Details.R` file (this is automatically ignored by Git to keep them private).

Run the Analysis.Rmd file in RStudio. This includes a basic analysis already to get you started.

# Troubleshooting

 * Make sure your R and RStudio installations are up-to-date

# Background

The [**Sheffield R Users**](http://sheffieldr.github.io/) group is organising a series of local [**National Biodiversity Hacks**](http://sheffieldr.github.io/nbn-hack/) throughout the month of **March**. The sessions will be hosted by the **Sheffield Methods Institute** and run from a great collaborative space located at the [Interdisciplinary Centre of the Social Sciences](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/icoss#) [[Map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Interdisciplinary+Centre+of+the+Social+Sciences/@53.3811084,-1.4839197,17z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x4879827f674a49cb:0xc3201928ecd6f113!2sInterdisciplinary+Centre+of+the+Social+Sciences!3b1!3m1!1s0x4879827f674a49cb:0xc3201928ecd6f113)]

#### **The overall philosophy of the hack series is: “no pressure, just learn and code for fun!”**


Having said that, here are a few specific ways in which we believe participants will benefit:

***




### **What you can expect to get involved in:**

<br>


#### **Make use of open data**


Data reserves are increasingly becoming openly available, with far reaching opportunity for a wide range of sectors. 
The [**National Biodiversity Network (NBN)**](http://nbn.org.uk/The-NBN/What-is-the-NBN.aspx) is a great example of a network of organisations making significant effort and investment to capture, integrate and make freely available the enormous reserves of UK biodiversity data.

One way in which data is made available is through the [**NBN Gateway**](https://data.nbn.org.uk/) for which the recently developed [**`rnbn`** package](http://www.nbn.org.uk/News/Latest-news/rNBN-is-an-R-package-for-retrieving-data-from-the.aspx) allows direct access through **`R`**. The hack will therefore provide an opportunity for participants to **explore the NBN gateway resource** and develop a **better awareness of what data are available and how to access it**.



<br>

#### **Help local wildlife organisations**


We've been in touch with the [**Sheffield & Rotherham Wildlife Trust**](http://www.wildsheffield.com/) and they could **do with some help** in their efforts to **describe the state of Sheffield nature**. They will be sending a representative to provide some guidance on ways we can help, from developing biodiversity indices, analysing temporal and spatial trends to producing monitoring dashboards. So the series will allow participants to contribute to real world solutions for the wider Sheffield community.




<br>

#### **Develop your `R` skills**

Hacks are great opportunities for **peer to peer knowledge transfer** and **learning through doing**. There really is no better way of gaining new skills than trying to implement them with direct access to people with expertise. [Even if you are a complete beginner, hacks are a great place to start](https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/hackathons-are-like-gyms-7ebcd6bfda26#.m0gwwa7cg) so we welcome participants of all levels and backgrounds.



<br>


#### **Learn to collaborate openly and effectively**

All work carried out during the series will be **coordinated through online repositories** and **open to the world allowing remote participation**. So at the very least, the hacks will provide opportunity to practice open collaborative working practices and using technologies like [**github**](https://github.com/), [**google hangouts**](https://hangouts.google.com/), [**etherpad**](http://etherpad.org/) etc. We also envisage that the series will strengthen our local network and act as a springboard for future collaborations.



<br>

#### **Innovate!**

Hacks provide a fun and informal space to **experiment and test out ideas** without the pressure of necessarily having to deliver a viable output. This also allows us to explore a **more diverse array of outputs** such as interactive visualisations and web applications.
